% start of content
The advancement of many engineering systems relies on novel design methodologies, design formulations, and design representations among other parts.
In this work, we consider three broad design domains: \textit{architecture}, \textit{plant}, and \textit{control}.
These domains cover most of the potential design elements of an engineering system (and in particular, of dynamic systems, or systems whose behavior evolves through time).
Allowing design flexibility (where appropriate) in all three of these domains is the first step for formulating, solving, and understanding novel and innovative design problems.
Furthermore, achieving design automation in these types of problems requires adequate theory and tools to support such considerable scope and complexity.
