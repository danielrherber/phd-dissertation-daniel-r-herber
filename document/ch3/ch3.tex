\epigraph{\textit{``If we want to solve problems effectively\dots we must keep in mind not only many features but also the influences among them. Complexity is the label we will give to the existence of many interdependent variables in a given system. The more variables and the greater their interdependence, the greater the system's complexity. Great complexity places high demands on a planner's capacity to gather information, integrate findings, and design effective actions.''}}{\textmd{D. D\"{o}rner} \cite[p.~38]{Dorner1997a}}
