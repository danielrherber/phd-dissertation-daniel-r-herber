Direct transcription is a solution strategy discussed briefly in Chapters~\ref{ch:3} and \ref{ch:4} for finding approximate solutions to dynamic optimization problems.
This chapter focuses on a particular subclass that is relevant to the two case studies in Chapters~\ref{ch:7} and \ref{ch:8}.
Both use the nested co-design strategy from Chapter~\ref{ch:3} so many control subproblems need to be solved and efficiency is paramount.
The methods developed in this chapter provide a single unified description to automatically generate and solve this class of problems, even if there are different architectures with a varying number of states and controls.
