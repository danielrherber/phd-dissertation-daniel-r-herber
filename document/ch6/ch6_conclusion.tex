\section{Summary\label{sec:ch6:conclusion}}

Here an enumeration-based synthesis methodology for passive analog circuits is described.
In the enumerative approach, all circuit topologies under certain graph structure specifications are generated and tested.
With a complete set of results, the most desirable circuit can be selected with guarantees on its optimality.
This methodology requires minimal initial knowledge, maintains complete design space coverage, and produces reusable information. 
Both presented examples (frequency response matching and low-pass filter realizability) demonstrated that enumeration is feasible for certain commonly-used synthesis problems, but is also a challenge to use for sufficiently demanding synthesis tasks.
The results are compared to existing approaches and show that some evolutionary approaches have produced minimum complexity or Pareto-optimal topologies.
Future work is to adapt the approach for additional synthesis tasks and better understand the types of synthesis problems that enumeration is an appropriate design methodology.
