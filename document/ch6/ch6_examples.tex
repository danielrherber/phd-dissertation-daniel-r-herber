\section{Examples\label{sec:ch6:examples}}

Two different kinds of passive analog synthesis problems (frequency response matching and low-pass filter realizability)
have been chosen as the design examples. 
Both of these problem types have been studied previously, so we can readily make comparisons to previous results.
All runs were performed on a single computer with an i7-6800K at 3.8 GHz (up to 12 threads available), 32 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM, \textsc{Windows} 10 64-bit, and \textsc{Matlab} 2017a.
All aspects of the synthesis tool are coded in the \textsc{Matlab} language\footnote{The synthesis codes are available at Ref.~\cite{github-pm-circuits}.}.
